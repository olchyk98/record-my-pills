# Record My Pills

An application I wrote while being sick.
It's a simple logging app created with combination of React and Zustand.


## Features

- Different types of pills (hardcoded)
- Ability to select amount of pills taken
- Persistent state (data is cached in `localStorage`)
- Real date for each record in the store
- Cache store schema validation
